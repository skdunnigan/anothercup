Hi there! I work in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System as the System-Wide Monitoring (SWMP) Program Manager at the Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR in St. Augustine, FL. This program collects 15-minute continuous water quality and weather data and therefore, I quickly jumped into R programming in order to be able to tackle working with this data (reaching the end of an Excel spreadsheet was a *moment* for me).

## Education

-   MS (2015): Biology with Coastal Biology Focus (UNF)
-   BS (2012): Biological Science with certificate in Living Marine Resources (FSU)

## Experience

-   2016 - present: System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) Manager (Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR), contracted through University of North Florida.
-   2020 - 2022: Data Manager for NERRS Science Collaborative Catalyst project ["Refining techniques for high-frequency monitoring of chlorophyll in the NERRS"](https://nerrssciencecollaborative.org/project/Dix20). The project code is here [`chla-nerrs-catalyst`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/chla-nerrs-catalyst) and includes my first attempt at a GitHub Pages site! (ðŸ’ƒPersonal achievement!)
-   2013 - 2021: Adjunct Instructor (University of North Florida)
-   2015 - 2016: Oyster Condition Assessment Field Technician (Florida Department of Environmental Protection)
