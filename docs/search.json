Welcome!\nI have written blogs before though nothing like this and especially not one with an emphasis on coding. It is very difficult to get a lot of my friends and family interested in the work that I do with R. Therefore, this blog is for me. It‚Äôs for me to be able to ‚Äútalk out‚Äù what I find and how I‚Äôm learning. It‚Äôs a way to discover new things or attempt data science challenges - I‚Äôve always wanted to participate in some of the TidyTuesday challenges!\nHave you ever figured out a solution to a problem that then presented itself again several weeks/months/years down the line and you forgot what your original fix was?1\nYeah‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been there a lot. That being said, I am also hoping this blog will be a great place to store all of these workflows for me (or anyone) to reference again in the future.\n\nWhy ‚ÄúAnother Cup‚Äù?\nWhy did I call this blog ‚ÄúAnother Cup‚Äù? Well, because some problems simply require another cup of a hot (or cold!) beverage to solve!2\nSo, here is to tackling new things with another cup of [whatever] in hand!\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nOkay, if you answered ‚Äúno‚Äù then you must be some sort of magician.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nI‚Äôm partial to coffee, myself.

    "text": "I work with water quality and meteorological data regularly with my work. As such, I am often trying to find creative ways to summarize and visualize this data to share with resource managers, educators, and colleagues. One of the recent challenges has been on how to present wind speed and direction data in an easy-to-digest format to other people.\nThis came about in my work summarizing the effects of recent hurricanes Ian (October 2022) and Nicole (November 2022) in northeast Florida. The typical way folks in my office have depicted wind data has been through the use of wind roses. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, wind roses have their usefulness! However, when it came to the matter of these hurricanes, I was also interested in a time element to the data that is just not captured well in a wind rose.\nHere‚Äôs an example of a wind rose from the openair package.\nFor this, I wanted to to see if there was a way to visualize the predominating wind directions and speeds in the days preceding, during, and following the hurricanes. So, I went down a Google rabbit hole attempting to examples of how others have attempted something like this in the past. I wanted something that:\nI ended up stumbling upon a great thread on Stack Overflow that used a raster grid-style plot where every cell had a latitude and longitude component as well as the wind speed and direction. Since I was visualizing wind data generated from a single, fixed station\nHere is the data we are working with: aggregated 15-minute wind speed (m/s) and direction data averaged to the hour.\nUsing the dplyr::mutate() function, I then pulled out the day and hour information from the datetimestamp variable and also converted wind speed into miles per hour (this is what is reported in the news).\nI used that thread on Stack Overflow to create a similar plot with a color scheme I preferred. Instead of latitude and longitude, I plotted by hour and day. I also used scale_x_continuous to break the x-axis so it is easier to read the hours in the day.\nI noticed something weird with the direction data, however, and after some reading into the code I realized that the geom_spoke function uses radians instead of degrees. So I needed to convert my degrees into radians. I also wanted these arrows to be pointing in the direction the wind is flowing, so I had to do some additional fudging. After all that, I have the plot below:\nAll in all, I enjoy this figure and like how this plot allows me to see the passage of the storm relative to the weather station. I‚Äôm still on the hunt for good data visualizations of wind, but for now, this was pretty nice!"
